# Portable Header

Header meant for inclusion in LibGuides and other third-party apps where you can paste some HTML in a box but not much else.

# Templating

Inside config.json, you can define strings that will be replaced in the SASS, JS, and HTML files. The strings to be replaced look like typical Mustache templates; double curly braces around their identifier, e.g. {{prefix}}. An example configuration for California College of the Arts is included.
